## Onboarding

### First Time Install

First, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), potentially using `git clone` in your preferred CLI to pull the project down to your computer.

Familiarize yourself with [common git commands](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf), [CLI commands](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp), and [what Git is](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) if you aren't already.

In your CLI, navigate to the folder for the project and run `npm install` to instruct [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) to install all neccessary packages.

## Contributor Guide

### Creating Issues & Suggesting Features

Navigate to the [GitHub repository issues page](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/PM-Dashboard-v2/issues) and click the "New Issue" button.

#### Issue Title

Give your issue an informative, but concise title that follows the naming syntax: `[Page] - [Description]`.
The page field should name one specific page within the application that the issue pertains to.
Alternatively, use `General` or `Docs` to indicate issues spanning the whole site or issues with the project's documentation.
The description field should briefly describe what the issue is.
Examples: `General - Increase Padding for Tables` or `Projects - Add Filter by Project Lead`.

#### Issue Description

Include the required information in the issue description based on the kind of issue you are submitting.

Bugs -> Observed Behavior, Expected Behavior, Steps to Reproduce, and Screenshots

New Features -> Current Features, Desired Additional Features, and Screenshots (as needed)

Other -> Desired Changes, Screenshots (as needed)

Add labels as is appropriate for the issue, and assign it to `@kevinyu328` or `@jamescd18` for review.
Reviewers will determine whether the issue is valid, whether it will be accepted and worked on, and which milestone it will be a part of.

### Creating a Branch

Use `git checkout -b [branch name]` to create a new branch.
Give the branch a short name that follows the naming syntax: `#[issue number]-[contributor name]`.
Example: `#12-JamesCD` or `#275-KevinYu`.

Use `git status` to check which branch you are on.
Ensure you stash, reset, or commit your changes before changing branches, unless you want to bring your changes to the other branch.
Use `git checkout main` to switch back to the main branch.

### Testing Your Code

### Running the App Locally

### Creating a Commit

Commit early and often (within reason) to properly save your work and to make your changes more easily separable.

Use `git commit -a -m [message]` to stage all changes and commit them with the message.
Use the following syntax for commit messages: `#[issue number] - [description of changes made]`.
Examples: `#12 - Expanded the creating commmits section` or `#79 - Increased list padding`.

See [common git commands](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/PM-Dashboard-v2#onboarding) for alternative methods for staging and committing changes.
