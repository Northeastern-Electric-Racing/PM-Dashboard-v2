First, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), potentially using `git clone` in your preferred CLI to pull the project down to your computer.

Familiarize yourself with [common git commands](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) and [CLI commands](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp) if you aren't already.

In your CLI, navigate to the folder for the project and run `npm install` to instruct [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) to install all neccessary packages.
